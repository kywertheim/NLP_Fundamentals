# NLP_Fundamentals

Context: I completed these guided programming exercises during the Coursera course entitled Natural Language Processing with Classification and Vector Spaces.

1. C1_W1_Assignment.ipynb:
This notebook records the use of logistic regression for sentiment analysis of tweets.

2. C1_W2_Assignment.ipynb:
This notebook records the use of Naive Bayes for sentiment analysis of tweets.

3. C1_W3_Assignment.ipynb:
This notebook centres around word embeddings (vectors). Cosine similarity is used to compare word embeddings and find analogies. Principal component analysis (PCA) is used to simplify and visualise word embeddings in 2D.

4. C1_W4_Assignment.ipynb:
This notebook records the procedures and results of two tasks. First, it describes a naive English-to-French translation system, which is a transformation matrix mapping one vector space (English word embeddings) to another (French word embeddings). Second, it presents a bag-of-words model and shows how the k-nearest neighbours algorithm can be combined with locality-sensitive hashing to find similar documents.
